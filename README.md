1. Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
</medium></strong></p>

For the Pirate Maze project, I was provided with all the necessary code except for the logic of the Q-Learning algorithm. I received the `TreasureMaze.py`file, which contains the maze structure, and the `GameExperience.py` file, which manages memory by storing and retrieving past experiences, allowing the agent to interact with the environment and learn from its previous moves. I also received a Jupyter Notebook with various predefined cells that included the training process, testing, and the implementation of the neural network along with its parameters. The main objective of the project was to complete the implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm and then use different epsilon values to evaluate their effects on the agentâ€™s learning process.
In order to see how the intelligent agent learns when uses exploitation and exploration.

2. Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science
</medium></strong></p>

Thanks to this course, I was able to understand the vital role that computer scientists play in today's digital world. Through their work, it is possible to create tools that not only facilitate people's daily lives but also transform how we work, communicate, and interact with the world around us. Computer scientists drive the automation of processes, enhance global communications, and promote technological advances that positively impact multiple areas of society.

3. What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
</medium></strong></p>

Computer scientists are professionals capable not only of developing tools that optimize how we manage our daily and professional lives but also of serving as a fundamental pillar in technological advancement. Thanks to interdisciplinary collaboration with other professionals such as mathematicians, engineers, and analysts, computer scientists can design innovative solutions that improve quality of life and solve complex problems. Their importance lies in their ability to drive technological evolution across diverse sectors such as medicine, education, finance, and communications.

4. How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
</medium></strong></p>

The correct way to approach a problem as a computer scientist is methodically and systematically. The first step is to clearly understand the problem and the requirements defined by the stakeholders. I then apply development methodologies such as Agile, which allow large problems to be broken down into smaller, manageable stages. This facilitates incremental development, where specific objectives are met at each stage, ensuring the quality of the final product. Additionally, this approach allows for adaptive solutions as new challenges arise, ensuring that the final result meets the characteristics, quality standards, and needs of the end users.

5. What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
</medium></strong></p>

It is crucial to highlight that, as a computing professional, I have ethical responsibilities to both the end users and the organization for which I develop products. I must ensure integrity, security, and transparency at all times. This includes protecting sensitive information I may have access to, avoiding any misuse, and designing secure systems that safeguard both user and organizational data. Furthermore, I must act with honesty and transparency, ensuring that the capabilities and limitations of the technological solutions are communicated clearly. Fulfilling these ethical responsibilities is essential to earn and maintain the trust of users, colleagues, and the organizations we work for.
